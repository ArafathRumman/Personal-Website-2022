                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>A web developer may focus on the back end or server-side of web delivery to ensure that a website functions correctly and efficiently, or on the front end helping to create interactions for users. Possible careers include Front-end Web Developer or Back-end Web Developer.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Web designers craft the overall vision and plan for a website. A web designer’s job is less about using code to bring a website to life and more about determining a site’s layout, color palette, font set, and visual themes.</p>

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>A Web Developer creates and designs different websites for clients. They are responsible for their aesthetic as well as their function. Professionals in this field may also need to be able to ensure sites are compatible with multiple types of media.</p>

                If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community. There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.
